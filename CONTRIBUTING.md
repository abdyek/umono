# Contributing to Umono

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Umono!

Umono is a small, opinionated project focused on simplicity, explicit design, and clear separation of concerns.

## How to contribute

- You can contribute by reporting bugs, improving documentation, or submitting code.
- For larger changes, please open an issue first to discuss the idea.
- Small fixes (typos, minor improvements, refactors) can be submitted directly as pull requests.

## Code contributions

- Keep changes small and focused.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Tests are welcome, but not mandatory.
- Simplicity matters more than adding features.

## Multiple repositories

If your change affects more than one repository (backend, admin UI, or language), please mention this in the issue or pull request description.

## Need help?

If you're unsure where to start, look for issues labeled `good first issue` or open a discussion.
